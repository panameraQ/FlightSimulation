# FlightSimulation
This can be simulated using a physics engine such as Box2D. The input parameters of velocity and angle will be used to calculate the initial force and direction of the object. This force will be applied to the object and its motion will be simulated in real-time. The output in distance of flight can then be calculated based on the position of the object at any given time.
